    "#### Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this assignment is to practice constructing linear models. You will start with a simple linear model. You will evaluate and interpret it (1p). Consequently, your task will be to improve this model using generalized linear models (GLMs) and feature transformations. You will get 1p for proposal and evaluation of GLM (family, evaluation, interpretation), 1p for correct feature transformations, 1p for proposal and justification of the final model and eventually, 1p for comprehensive evaluation of all the model improvements (ablation study through cross-validation, note that the previous evaluations must be done without cross-validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input data \n",
    "In this assignment, you will work with a student dataset. The dataset contains 200 samples and 4 features: *num_awards* is the outcome variable and indicates the number of awards earned by students in a year, *math* is a continuous predictor variable and represents students’ scores on their math final exam, *prog* is a categorical predictor variable with three levels indicating the type of program in which the students were enrolled (1 = “General”, 2 = “Academic” and 3 = “Vocational”), and *work* is a continuous predictor that gives the number of hours that students spent at work on average per week.\n",

    "Let us start with an ordinary linear model with no feature transformations. Explain how far the model works (does it meet formal assumptions?, does it overcome the null model?). Which predictors would you keep there and which of them are not useful? Use the standard evaluation procedures that we have for linear models (notice, that GML with Gaussian family corresponds to an OLS model, only the summary is slightly more general).\n"

    "### Generalized linear model\n",
    "Now, the goal is to implement a generalized linear model that conceptually fits the given task. Do not transform the predictors yet, use them as they are, or omit them from the model. Once you obtain your model, interpret the effect of the *math* predictor on the outcome. How (according to your model) increasing a math score by one point affects the number of awards won? \n",

Based on the observations, propose suitable transformations for them (or, justify that they are truly uninformative for prediction of *num_awards*) and implement them into the best model found by now. Use the *compareGLM()* function to validate that your new GLMs indeed improved over the simple one.\n",
