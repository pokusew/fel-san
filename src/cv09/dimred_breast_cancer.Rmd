## PCA in a medical dataset
Breast cancer dataset can be also downloaded here https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

```{r}
data <- read.csv("breast_cancer.csv")
data <- data %>%
  dplyr::select(-id, -X) # remove unnecessary columns

# Explore the data (e.g. with glimpse()). How many dimensions are there?
data_numeric <- data %>%
  dplyr::select(-diagnosis)

# Perform PCA
data_pca <- prcomp(data_numeric)

lbs <- data$diagnosis # Save the diagnosis as color labels

# Plot the PCA projection. Is it a good projection given how many features we have?
fviz_pca_ind(___, geom.ind = "point", pointshape = 21,
             fill.ind = lbs,
             palette = "jco",
             addEllipses = TRUE,
             legend.title = "Diagnosis") +
  ggtitle("Breast cancer 2D PCA-plot") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

# Questions>
# 1. What are the disadvantages using all features e.g. in a classification task and visualization?
# 2. How would you choose the "right ones"?
```

## tSNE approach to dimensionality reduction

```{r}
# install.packages("Rtsne")
library(Rtsne)

# Learn about the perplexity argument in the docs and try different values (suggested values are between 10 and 100)
tsne_res <- Rtsne::Rtsne(data_numeric, perplexity = ___)

# Plot the t-SNE projection
tsne_res$Y %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  # Add labels to the projection
  mutate(diagnosis = data$diagnosis) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=V1, y=V2, col=diagnosis)) +
  geom_point()

# Question>
# What happens with the projection if you increase/decrease the perplexity values?
# How does the projection differ compared to PCA?
```

## PCA revisited
Test your understanding of PCA after learning its mechanics.
```{r}
# How many components do we need to sufficiently capture data?
summary(data_pca)

# What is the primary composition of first two principal components
biplot(data_pca)

# The labels in the plot might be too dense. Can you obtain the same information other way?
____
```



```{r}
# LDA
labels <- data$diagnosis %>% as.factor()
# Load the LDA() and other supporting function from the 3rd assignment into the environment.
# Now you can compare LDA and PCA dimensionality reduction:
eigenLDA <- LDA(data_numeric, labels)
```
